Don't merge paths with media queries if they may affect dangerous properties. In this particular example it would
be OK to merge, but in general the analysis is difficult - it would require examining all permuations of media queries, 
parent nodes, etc. to ensure that there was no possibility of a stroke which had a URL reference.
